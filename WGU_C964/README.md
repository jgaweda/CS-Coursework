# A.  Create a letter of transmittal and a project proposal to convince senior, non-technical managers and executives to implement the data product you have designed. The proposal should include each of the following:

•  a summary of the problem

•  a description of how the data product benefits the customer and supports the decision-making process

•  an outline of the data product

•  a description of the data that will be used to construct the data product

•  the objectives and hypotheses of the project

•  an outline of the project methodology

•  funding requirements

•  the impact of the solution on stakeholders

•  ethical and legal considerations and precautions that will be used when working with and communicating about sensitive data

•  your expertise relevant to the solution you propose



Note: Expertise described here could be real or hypothetical to fit the project topic you have created.

## B.  Write an executive summary directed to IT professionals that addresses each of the following requirements:

•  the decision-support problem or opportunity you are solving for

•  a description of the customers and why this product will fulfill their needs

•  existing gaps in the data products you are replacing or modifying (if applicable)

•  the data available or the data that needs to be collected to support the data product lifecycle

•  the methodology you use to guide and support the data product design and development

•  deliverables associated with the design and development of the data product

•  the plan for implementation of your data product, including the anticipated outcomes from this development

•  the methods for validating and verifying that the developed data product meets the requirements and subsequently the needs of the customers

•  the programming environments and any related costs, as well as the human resources that are necessary to execute each phase in the development of the data product

•  a projected timeline, including milestones, start and end dates, duration for each milestone, dependencies, and resources assigned to each task


## C.  Design and develop a fully functional data product that addresses your identified business problem or organizational need. Include each of the following attributes as they are the minimum required elements for the product:

•  one descriptive method and one non-descriptive (predictive or prescriptive) method

•  collected or available datasets

•  decision-support functionality

•  ability to support featurizing, parsing, cleaning, and wrangling datasets

•  methods and algorithms supporting data exploration and preparation

•  data visualization functionalities for data exploration and inspection

•  implementation of interactive queries

•  implementation of machine-learning methods and algorithms

•  functionalities to evaluate the accuracy of the data product

•  industry-appropriate security features

•  tools to monitor and maintain the product

•  a user-friendly, functional dashboard that includes at least three visualization types

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

•  a business vision or business requirements document

•  raw and cleaned data sets with the code and executable files used to scrape and clean data (if applicable)

•  code used to perform the analysis of the data and construct a descriptive, predictive, or prescriptive data product

•  assessment of the hypotheses for acceptance or rejection

•  visualizations and elements of effective storytelling supporting the data exploration and preparation, data analysis, and data summary, including the phenomenon and its detection

•  assessment of the product’s accuracy

•  the results from the data product testing, revisions, and optimization based on the provided plans, including screenshots

•  source code and executable file(s)
